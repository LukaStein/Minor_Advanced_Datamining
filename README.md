# Minor_Advanced_Datamining
In this repository I document all tasks and theory from subject "Advanced Datamining" in the minor I'm pursuing for Bio-informatics year 3

> In chapter 4, I worked on multinominal classification.

> In chapter 5, I worked on applying early stopping.

> In the final exercise the model script is put to testing. A check if all implementations work and an exercise to predict grayscale pictures of hand gestures with 12x12 pixels.
The data set contains 33.600 instances that per 1.400 instances encode for 24 letters (except Z and J) that are depicted with the hand gestures.
